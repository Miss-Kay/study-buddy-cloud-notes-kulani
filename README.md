⚡ Deployment Guide
1️⃣ Clone Repo

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/study-buddy-cloud-notes.git
cd study-buddy-cloud-notes

2️⃣ Setup S3 Bucket

aws s3 mb s3://study-buddy-notes-<yourname>
aws s3 website s3://study-buddy-notes-<yourname>/ --index-document index.html

3️⃣ Deploy Lambdas

Upload lambda_upload.py and lambda_fetch.py to AWS Lambda.
Make sure to set an S3 Bucket name inside each Lambda file.
4️⃣ Setup API Gateway

    /upload → POST → Lambda (Upload)

    /fetch → GET → Lambda (Fetch)

    Enable CORS

5️⃣ Update Frontend

In frontend/index.html, replace:

const API_BASE = "YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL";

6️⃣ Upload Frontend to S3

aws s3 cp frontend/index.html s3://study-buddy-notes-<yourname>/

7️⃣ Test

    Open your S3 static site URL in browser.

    Upload a note → Copy Note ID → Fetch → 🎉

🎯 Future Enhancements

    🔐 Add authentication with AWS Cognito (only students can upload).

    📊 Use DynamoDB to store metadata (author, subject, date).

    📱 Build a mobile-friendly UI (React/Flutter).
